# Hello There! I'm **Damian**

I’m 22 years old student living in Poland, that got into front-end development in 2019. Before that I&nbsp;really enjoyed graphics design, but that changed with my first internship. During that period I&nbsp;was doing graphics for company and after that my hype on graphics went down, but then I&nbsp;learned about UI&nbsp;design. Shortly after I&nbsp;started to learn more advanced elements of front-end like CSS preprocessors, javascript and javascript frameworks. I’ve made plenty of school projects and with every one I&nbsp;saw my progress.

Currently I'm studing Computer Science at Silesian University.
